### Description

I would like to show my recent project, following the SQL Covid Analysis post, here is the Tableau visualization using tables created from SQL queries in the Covid project. Exploratory data analysis on the COVID-19 dataset retrieved from link. I performed some of the following procedures using  #SQL functions such as CTEs, as well as Joining & partitioning death and vaccination tables. I downloaded and imported data ranging from October 2020 - October 2022. Creating individual tables ready for visualization in tableau. Finally created the visualizations in tableau and built the dashboard below!
