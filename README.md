### Description
The Tableau project for Airbnb in Seattle in 2023 reveals interesting insights into the pricing trends for Airbnb listings in the area. One key observation is that the average price of listings is almost steady throughout the year, with the exception of an increase in July.

Upon further investigation, this increase in price in July could be due to the fact that it is a peak tourist season for Seattle. With more visitors coming to the city during the summer months, the demand for Airbnb accommodations increases, leading to an increase in pricing.

In terms of room types, the Tableau project also highlights a notable difference in the average price between entire apartments and private or shared rooms. The average price for entire apartments is $180.8, which is significantly higher than the average price for private rooms, which is $94.5, and shared rooms, which is $61.

This suggests that the cost of renting an entire apartment is generally higher due to the additional space and amenities that come with it.
We can see that the number of entire home or apartments is far higher than that of the whole other types of rooms (private or shared). It means the entire home or apartments are in high demand in comparison to other houses, despite of their higher price.

In conclusion, the Tableau project for Airbnb in Seattle in 2023 shows that while the average price of listings is relatively steady throughout the year, there is a noticeable increase in July likely due to peak tourist season. Additionally, the comparison between different room types reveals that entire apartments are generally more expensive than private or shared rooms. These insights can be valuable for hosts looking to optimize their pricing strategies and for travelers looking to budget for their accommodations in Seattle.
