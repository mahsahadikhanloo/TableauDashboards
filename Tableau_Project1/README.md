### Description

The Tableau project for Airbnb in Seattle in 2023 reveals interesting insights into the pricing trends for Airbnb listings in the area. One key observation is that the average price of listings is almost steady throughout the year, with the exception of an increase in July.

Upon further investigation, this increase in price in July could be due to the fact that it is a peak tourist season for Seattle. With more visitors coming to the city during the summer months, the demand for Airbnb accommodations increases, leading to an increase in pricing.

In terms of room types, the Tableau project also highlights a notable difference in the average price between entire apartments and private or shared rooms. The average price for entire apartments is $180.8, which is significantly higher than the average price for private rooms, which is $94.5, and shared rooms, which is $61.

This suggests that the cost of renting an entire apartment is generally higher due to the additional space and amenities that come with it.
We can see that the number of entire home or apartments is far higher than that of the whole other types of rooms (private or shared). It means the entire home or apartments are in high demand in comparison to other houses, despite of their higher price.

In conclusion, the Tableau project for Airbnb in Seattle in 2023 shows that while the average price of listings is relatively steady throughout the year, there is a noticeable increase in July likely due to peak tourist season. Additionally, the comparison between different room types reveals that entire apartments are generally more expensive than private or shared rooms. These insights can be valuable for hosts looking to optimize their pricing strategies and for travelers looking to budget for their accommodations in Seattle.

### Description

The Airbnb dataset for 2016 provides information on the various listings on the Airbnb platform. One interesting aspect of the data is the comparison of the average price by room type. In this report, we will look at the average price of room types ranging from 0 to 6.

Starting with the smallest room type, the average price of a room type 0, which is typically a private room in a shared space, is $105.2. Moving up to room type 1, which is a private room in an entire apartment or house, the average price slightly declines to $96.2. For room type 2, which is a whole apartment or house, the average price jumps to $175.4.

When looking at larger room types, the average price continues to increase. Room type 3, which is typically a multi-bedroom apartment or house, has an average price of $249.7. Room type 4, which is usually a large house or villa, has an average price of $315.4. Room type 5, which could be a mansion or castle, has an average price of $450.0. Finally, room type 6, which includes unique spaces such as treehouses or igloos, has an average price of $584.8.

We can see that the number of houses with only one bedroom is far higher than that of the whole other houses. It means the houses with one bedroom are in high demand in comparison to other houses.

Also we can see an ever-increasing trend for the revenue in year 2016. Regardless of the specific reasons, an increasing revenue over time is generally seen as a positive indicator of business success and can contribute to long-term growth and profitability.

In conclusion, the Airbnb data for 2016 shows a clear trend of increasing average price as the bedrooms increase in size and luxury. This information can be useful for hosts to determine the optimal listing price for their space, and for travelers to budget accordingly for their accommodations.
